# problem statement
'''A retail company wants to predict customer purchasing behaviour
based on their age, salary and past purchase history.
The company aims to use K-Nearest Neightbor (KNN) algorithm 
to classify customers into potential buying group to personalize marketing strategies.
This predictive model will help the company understand and target specific customer segments 
more effectively, thereby increasing sales and customer satisfaction.'''

The goal is to classify customers into potential buying groups based on their:

Age
Salary
Past purchase history
The classification will allow personalized marketing strategies, potentially improving sales and customer satisfaction.

Steps to Solve

1. Data Understanding and Preprocessing

i)Dataset Collection:

.Collect relevant customer data, including:
.Age
.Salary
.Past purchase history (e.g., frequency of purchase, total spent, product categories, etc.)
.Label: Indicating whether they are a "potential buyer" or not.

ii)Data Cleaning:

.Handle missing values.
.Remove outliers, if any, using statistical methods (e.g., z-scores or IQR).

iii)Feature Encoding:

.Convert categorical features (e.g., purchase categories) into numerical values using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

iv)Normalization/Scaling:

.Scale features (e.g., Age, Salary) to bring them to a comparable range using techniques like MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   
i)Visualize relationships between features and labels:

.Scatter plots for Age vs. Salary.
.Histograms of purchase frequency.
.Box plots for spending patterns.

ii)Check for class imbalance:

.Ensure the target variable (potential buyer or not) has a balanced distribution.

3. Implementing KNN Algorithm
   
i)Split Data:

.Divide the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 70%-30% or 80%-20%).

ii)Model Training:

.Use the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm:
.Select the optimal value of K using cross-validation.
.Use distance metrics like Euclidean or Manhattan, depending on the feature space.

iii)Model Evaluation:

.Evaluate the model using metrics such as:
.Accuracy
.Precision
.Recall
.F1-score
.Confusion Matrix
.Perform ROC-AUC analysis for additional insight.

4. Optimization and Hyperparameter Tuning
   
i)Tune the following parameters:

.Number of neighbors (K).
.Distance metric (e.g., Minkowski, Euclidean, Manhattan).
.Weighting (uniform or distance-based).

ii)Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV for systematic tuning.

5. Monitoring and Maintenance

i)Regularly update the model with new data.
ii)Monitor performance to ensure accuracy and relevance.

Potential Challenges

i)Class Imbalance: Address using oversampling techniques (e.g., SMOTE) if necessary.
ii)Curse of Dimensionality: If too many irrelevant features are included, reduce dimensionality using techniques like PCA.
iii)Scalability: KNN can be computationally expensive for large datasets. Optimize using Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN) or dimensionality reduction.
